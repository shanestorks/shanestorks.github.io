I'm a PhD student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan. There, I work with [Joyce Y. Chai](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~chaijy/) and the [Situated Language and Embodied Dialogue (SLED)](https://sled.eecs.umich.edu/) group on research in robust natural language and multimodal inference.

Earlier, I graduated from Lawrence Technological University with my BS majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science and minoring in Physics. Meanwhile, I worked as a .NET programmer and data analyst, and volunteered extensively with [Macomb Science Olympiad](http://macombso.org/).
